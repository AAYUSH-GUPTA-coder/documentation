You can use Chainlink Data Feeds to connect your smart contracts to asset pricing data like the [ETH / USD feed](https://data.chain.link/eth-usd). This guide uses the [Chainlink Hardhat Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit) to show you how to programatically read Chainlink Data Feeds and deploy contracts that can use this data onchain.

## Before you begin

- If you are new to smart contract development, learn how to [Deploy Your First Smart Contract](/quickstarts/deploy-your-first-contract/) before you start this guide.
- Install a [NodeJS LTS version](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Hardhat supports only LTS versions of NodeJS.

1. Clone the [Chainlink Hardhat Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit) repository and change directories:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit.git &&
   cd hardhat-starter-kit
   ```

1. Install the NPM packages:

   ```shell
   npm i
   ```

1. Compile the test contracts:

   ```shell
   npx hardhat test
   ```

1. Export your RPC endpoint to an environment variable. You can use a public endpoint or provide your own:

   ```shell
   export SEPOLIA_RPC_URL='https://ethereum-sepolia.publicnode.com'
   ```

1. Run the script to read a Data Feed offchain. This example reads from the BTC/USD feed on Sepolia Testnet:

   ```shell
   npx hardhat read-price-feed --contract 0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43 --network sepolia
   ```
